Whist has long been known for its influence upon what is 
termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order 
of intellect have been known to take an apparently 
unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. 
Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so 
greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best 
chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the 
best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies 
capacity for success in all these more important 
undertakings where mind struggles with mind.

-- Edgar Allen Poe
